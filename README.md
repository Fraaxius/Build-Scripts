# Build-Scripts

Here you will find scripts to build the roms that Fraaxius currently builds.

# ¡Time to clone!

Go to the folder where you currently have your workspace.

Example:
```
:~$ cd ResurrectionRemix
```

Now, clone the repo in your workspace.

Example: 
```
git clone https://github.com/Fraaxius/Build-Scripts -b main Build-Scripts/
```

# Last step: ¡Go to use! ✨

After cloning the repository, it's time to use the build magic!
```
source Build-Scripts/nash-rr.sh (If you select other script, replace the file)
```

# Are you ready! Time to use good magic!
